about: Probably the coolest of the group, Kaden is a self taught developer residing in North Vancouver. On top of being a self taught developer, his badassery extends to being a dangerous martial artist with a white belt in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. If you feel intimidated by how awesome he sounds, don't worry, he's still human like the rest of us.
