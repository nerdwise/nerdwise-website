  what_we_do:
    - Deliver custom high-end bespoke websites.
  how_we_do:
    - A kick-off meeting will outline your goals, sort out budgets, timelines,
      priorities and the desired final product. This is where we'll find out if
      we're the right team for your needs.
    - After coming back to you with an action plan, we'll set you up with tools
      to set priorities, track progress, directly control the words and images
      on your site and see live updates.
    - Once you're happy we'll launch! And if you're into it, kick off planning
      post-launch campaign updates and performance monitoring.
    - Now all that's left is to give us a shout and kick this process off! :)
  why_we_do:
    - We're nerds. We love marrying beautiful designs with high performance
      code.
