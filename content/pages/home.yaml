  what_we_do:
    - Deliver completely custom high-end bespoke websites.
    - Your business isn't a copy-paste, your site shouldn't be either.
  how_we_do:
    - Built with intent every step of the way.
    - We take pride in creating valuable sites for our clients. You didn't set
      out to create a website for its own sake. Your site is a tool in your
      business's arsenal to help drive sales and build customer engagement. We
      get that, we had the same motivations when we built this site :)
    - Any project we start will kick off with a meeting to discuss budgets,
      timelines, priorities and the desired final product.
    - We'll come back to you shortly thereafter with an actionable plan
      outlining what we can deliver.
    - Then, once we've received your go-ahead, we'll setup a GitHub repo to work
      on your project. If that doesn't sound familiar, don't worry, we'll run
      you through it. In short, it's where you'll be able to set priorities and
      manage progress in real time.
    - At the same time we'll set you up with access to our content management
      system (CMS), where you'll have complete control over what goes on your
      site.
    - As we work you'll have access to a staging server where you can see
      the changes we're making as we make them.
    - Once we get to a point where you're happy to go live, we'll push the
      button and your site will be visible to the world.
    - After the launch, if you'd like, you can monitor the performance of what
      we've built with Google Analytics and adjust the site as needed to really
      cater to your customers.
    - Our relationship doesn't have to end after the first launch either, we can
      continue to deliver post-launch pages and designs as well as setting you
      up with scheduled builds so that you can edit content in the CMS and see
      it live on the site automatically.
    - Now all that's left is to give us a shout and kick this process off! :)
  why_we_do:
    - We're nerds and we love what we do, marrying beautiful designs with
      high performance code.
